# Fraud_Detection



Imagine standing at the gas pump, filling up your car for a long road trip with your friends. As you go to pay, the attendant announces that your card has been declined. In this moment, you probably aren't thinking about the data science that determined your fate. Embarrassed, and certain you have the funds to cover the gas, you try your card again. Same result. As you step aside and allow the attendant to tend to the next customer, you receive a text message from your bank. "Press 1 if you really tried to spend $200 on gas." 
While perhaps inconvenient (and often embarrassing) in the moment, this fraud prevention system is actually saving consumers millions of dollars per year. By using advanced algorithms and data analysis, banks are able to detect unusual spending patterns and prevent fraudulent transactions before they happen.
